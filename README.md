# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This task involves working with the Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information from the ill-fated Titanic ship. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, class, and whether passengers survived or not. The objective is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a passenger survived or not
